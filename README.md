# Welcome to my portfolio !

Here is my portfolio, I will tell you how I deployed my portfolio, which apps I use to optimize my website

## How to install it ?
You have many ways to install my website but here's two methods of it:
* ```git clone with the link ssh```
* Download Zip and extract the zip file
Don't forget to use ```sass --watch style.scss:style.css```

## How to open it ?
You have many ways to open my portfolio website:
* Since you downloaded the zip, you can open it with html file.
* Directly on your website browser with the deployement I did.

## How I deployed it ?

I did deploy with Vercel app, that can optimize my code and website that each commit and push, it will automatically update to the website. I used another app called imgbot that can optimize all images I used to load faster the website, otherwise it will be much slower if the website has big images file. I also used codefactor to check code quality for see if there's any error or else.

## How I update my portfolio

All I do to update my porfolio is adding file little by little to add like which file is added, which file is updated etc. 
```git add filename``` <br>
```git commit -m "Insert Your commit messages"``` <br>
```git push```
